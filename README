# musicbrainz

A simple tool that recursively scans a directory for mp3s, gets an artist list
from the id3 tags then uses musicbrainz to build a list of all the releases of
all the artists in order of release date.

Written in clojure.

TODO: 
 * make a proper library.
 * support pulling in all results automatically (musicbrainz returns a default
   of 25 results, and an offset option needs to be used with subsequent calls
   to get all the results
 * needs much faster mp3 scanning.
 * Perhaps some caching of previous results/scanned files.
 * storing of results in a database to allow customisable reports.

## Usage
